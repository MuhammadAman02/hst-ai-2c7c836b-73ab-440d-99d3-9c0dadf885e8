"HST Solutions \u2013 Secure Document Validation for Credit Unions Overview: HST Solutions is developing a secure document validation application to help Credit Unions detect and prevent fraud during the customer verification process. This tool will streamline backend checks on commonly submitted documents, including:  Bank statements  Payslips  Irish Residency Permits (IRP)  Personal Public Service Numbers (PPSN)  Tax-related records  The system will use a rules-based validation engine to analyze key parameters like document formatting, income declarations, and cross-document consistency. It will highlight anomalies and red flags, allowing faster, more accurate decisions and reducing manual review efforts.  Problem Statement 1. Challenges in Manual Document Verification a. Lack of Reliable Document Authenticity Validation Fraudulent documents often mimic legitimate formats, including:  Forged logos  Photo mismatches  Incorrect templates  Falsified tax forms  These are difficult to detect manually.  b. Inconsistencies and Errors Within Documents Manual reviewers often overlook:  Mismatched salary figures  Incorrect balance carry-forwards  Discrepancies in dates like Date of Birth (DOB)  This can lead to fraud going undetected or eligibility being incorrectly assessed.  c. Mismatch of Information Across Documents Cross-document inconsistencies often go unnoticed, such as:  Different names, DOBs, or employer details  Salary discrepancies between payslips and bank statements  d. Non-Compliance with Regulatory Standards Many documents fail to meet country-specific regulatory formats (e.g., IBAN, PPS numbers, tax codes), increasing the risk of accepting invalid information.  e. Behavioral Patterns Indicative of Fraud Go Undetected Manual checks fail to identify contextual red flags such as:  Unusually high or round salary figures  Irregular transaction patterns  Reuse of documents in unrelated applications (suggesting fraud rings)  Validation Mechanisms 1. Document Authenticity Checks Verifies if documents were issued by a legitimate authority:  Template matching with official layouts  Verification of seals, watermarks, and holograms  Logo placement and font type validation  Government-issued tax document format verification  Driver\u2019s license category and issuing authority checks  2. Content Consistency & Integrity Checks Ensures internal consistency within documents:  Cross-field consistency (e.g., name across all pages)  Matching dates (e.g., consistent DOB)  Matching totals, deductions, and net pay  Carry-forward balance validation in bank statements  Payslip salary matching bank deposits  3. Cross-Document Verification Validates data alignment across multiple documents:  Matching name, DOB, and address  PPS number consistency across documents  Salary in bank statements vs. payslips  Employer name consistency in payslips and tax statements  4. Regulatory & Structural Validation Ensures compliance with official formats:  PPS number structure (Ireland: 7 digits + 1\u20132 letters)  Bank account format (e.g., IBAN, sort code)  Tax code format validation (e.g., TIN, PAN)  5. Behavioral & Contextual Analysis Detects fraud patterns based on behavior:  Unusually high or rounded salary values  Multiple salary deposits per month  Suspicious transaction spikes before applications  Document reuse in unrelated applications  Solution Components \u25cf Document Processing System Capable of processing high-risk documents such as:  Bank statements  Payslips  Identity documents  PPSNs and tax records  \u25cf Business Rules for Verification Uses predefined rules to validate and approve only authentic documents.  \u25cf Data Extraction Mechanism Extracts key data points for automated validation and analysis.  \u25cf Data Validation Checks Validates extracted data for:  Accuracy  Consistency  Authenticity Includes checks with official databases like tax authorities and public registries.  \u25cf Exception Handling Discrepancies or anomalies are flagged for:  Fast investigation by compliance teams  Efficient management of high-risk cases"
